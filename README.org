* Silver-Brain 

** Overview

*** Prologue

Back to the time when I was preparing the final examinations as a bachelor
student. I wrote down all the concepts to a big white paper in a structured
way in order to review what I have learned. I draw lines between concepts and
labeled the relationship. For each concept, I wrote some text describing it
(usually the paper was too small for large trunk of text).

After Emacs and its decent Org Mode became best partner for my electronic
life, I always wanted a software that helps me record everything in a
structured way, like described above.

I found [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][org-brain]]. I used it for some time, but there were some drawbacks that
made me stop using it:
- [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain/issues/127][Issue #127]] is a very important reason. Not being able to use rich-text in it
  really made me sad. (This issue has been fixed now.)
- Although it is doable via ~org-brain-rename-file~, but the inconsistency
  between file name and concept name made me uncomfortable, really.
- I was concerned about the performance of plain text when the number of
  concepts grow too large.

*** Introduction

Silver Brain is a [[https://www.thebrain.com/][Brain]] like software and is directly inspired by
[[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][org-brain]]. It helps you build your very own personal knowledge center.

It has the following features:

- Edit concepts using Emacs Org Mode (or probably other major modes in
  future).
- Maintain the relationship between concepts, including paternity and
  friendship.

The following technical decisions were made:

- Concepts are stored in a single SQLite file. Easy to maintain and
  synchronize.
- Separation between back-end and front-end. This makes it possible to develop
  another UI. The directory ~web-ui/~ contains a proof-of-concept
  demonstration.
- Back-end code was written in Common Lisp (a bless or a curse).

** Usage

*** Installation

**** External Dependencies

Make sure ~SQLite 3~ is installed on your system.

**** Add silver-brain System to ASDF Path

It is essential for the following installation process. And it is a good idea
if you would like to load silver-brain using ASDF during manual installation.

- When using Roswell, you may simply create a symbolic link of ~silver-brain~
directory in =~/.roswell/local-projects/= directory.

- Otherwise, you need to add the path of Silver Brain to
  ~asdf:*central-registry*~.

**** Using Installation Script

An installation script is provided for the sake of quick installation. Before
running it, you need to put Silver Brain project under a directory that your
local ASDF can find, i.e. ~(ql:quickload :silver-brain)~ does work.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd /path/to/silver-brain/
./install.sh
#+END_SRC

It mainly does the following things:
1. Build back-end server using Roswell.
2. Install the generated binary to =~/.roswell/bin/= directory.
3. Copy Emacs Lisp files to =~/.silver-brain/= directory.

You may need to add =~/.roswell/bin/= to your ~PATH~ in order to use
~silver-brain~ anywhere.

**** Installing Manually

***** Installing Back-End Server

****** Roswell Way

It is highly recommended to use Roswell to build and install Lisp systems for
its simplicity.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd /path/to/silver-brain/backend/
ros build silver-brain.ros
#+END_SRC

****** Legacy Way

It is a little bit complicated not to use Roswell. You may load Silver Brain
into an image and dump it.

See [[https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/scripting.html][The Common Lisp Cookbook]] for more details.

***** Installing Emacs UI Code

Copy the ~emacs/~ directory to somewhere Emacs can find.

**** Configuration

The server uses ~5000~ as the port. Currently this cannot be changed unless
modifying the source code.

For Emacs UI to work, the following snippet needs to be added into the Emacs
configuration file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.silver-brain/emacs/")
(use-package silver-brain
  :init
  ;; The port of back-end server. Does NOT affect server side.
  (setq silver-brain-server-port 5000)

  :bind
  ("C-c b" . silver-brain))
#+END_SRC

*** Manual

**** Concepts

The core concept of Silver Brain is /concept/. A concept a node in your
knowledge network. It contains title, content etc.

Concepts are connected via /relations/. A concept can be either parent, child
or friend of another one. You may think of parent/child as a single
directional link, while friend is a bi-directional link.

Practically, parent/child can be used to connect concepts with logical
precedence, e.g. ~Editor~ and ~Emacs~. And friend can be used to connect
concepts with slightly weak relations, e.g. ~Emacs~ and ~Vim~, hopefully ;-)

**** Software

The back-end server accepts ~-h~ or ~--help~ argument. Please refer to the
help.

For Emacs side, the command ~silver-brain~ is the entry point of the software.

The following is a list of commands defined for ~silver-brain-mode~:

|--------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------|
| Command                        | Binding | Description                      |
|--------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------|
| silver-brain-refresh           | g       | Refresh current concept          |
| silver-brain-new-concept       | n       | Create a new concept             |
| silver-brain-rename            | r       | Rename current concept           |
| silver-brain-save              | s       | Save changes of current concept  |
| silver-brain                   | o       | Open a new concept               |
| silver-brain-new-window        | O       | Open a new concept in new window |
| silver-brain-delete            | d       | Delete current concept           |
| silver-brain-add-parent        | p       | Add a parent of current concept  |
| silver-brain-add-child         | c       | Add a child of current concept   |
| silver-brain-add-friend        | f       | Add a friend of current concept  |
| silver-brain-remove-relation   | R       | Remove a relational concept      |
| silver-brain-kill-concept      | q       | Kill the concept window          |
| silver-brain-kill-all-concepts | Q       | Kill all the concept windows     |
|--------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------|

*** Implementation

Silver Brain was designed as a traditional Web application that back-end and
front-end code communicates via HTTP requests. The concepts and relations are
stored in a local SQLite file.

The ~web-ui~ directory contains browser UI code written using Vuetify.

** Known Issues

*** The Software Needs to Be Restarted If DB file is Changed Externally

If you use a synchronization software, such as Syncthing, you may need to
restart the software after the DB file got synchronized.

This is because the database needs to be re-connected while the current
version of Silver Brain cannot handle it well.

*** The Newly Updated Content is Not Shown

If you run ~silver-brain-refresh~ after some modification and says ~yes~ to
save the new contents, you may notice that the content buffer reverts to the
original state.

The solution is simply refreshing the buffer again.

This is because when ~silver-brain-save~ is triggered, the modifications are
not transferred to the server, thus the first ~silver-brain-refresh~ command
will receive the old content.
